# silu

Status: Has OpInfo tests, Used in TorchBench

## PyTorch Documentation

Apply the Sigmoid Linear Unit (SiLU) function, element-wise.

The SiLU function is also known as the swish function.

.. math::
    \text{silu}(x) = x * \sigma(x), \text{where } \sigma(x) \text{ is the logistic sigmoid.}

.. note::
    See `Gaussian Error Linear Units (GELUs) <https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08415>`_
    where the SiLU (Sigmoid Linear Unit) was originally coined, and see
    `Sigmoid-Weighted Linear Units for Neural Network Function Approximation
    in Reinforcement Learning <https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03118>`_ and `Swish:
    a Self-Gated Activation Function <https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05941v1>`_
    where the SiLU was experimented with later.

See :class:`~torch.nn.SiLU` for more details.

## Implementation

Place your generated kernel implementation in this directory as:
- `silu_implementation_v1.py`
- `silu_implementation_v2.py`
- etc.

Each implementation file should contain a function named:
```python
def silu_kernel_impl(*args, **kwargs):
    # Your implementation here
    # Should match the behavior documented above
    pass
```

## Testing

The DirectoryBackend will automatically load the first implementation file found in this directory.
