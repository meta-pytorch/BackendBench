# convolution

Status: Core PyTorch operator, Used in TorchBench

## PyTorch Documentation

conv2d(input, weight, bias=None, stride=1, padding=0, dilation=1, groups=1) -> Tensor

Applies a 2D convolution over an input image composed of several input
planes.

This operator supports :ref:`TensorFloat32<tf32_on_ampere>`.

See :class:`~torch.nn.Conv2d` for details and output shape.

Note:
    In some circumstances when given tensors on a CUDA device and using CuDNN, this operator may select a nondeterministic algorithm to increase performance. If this is undesirable, you can try to make the operation deterministic (potentially at a performance cost) by setting ``torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True``. See :doc:`/notes/randomness` for more information.

Note:
    This operator supports complex data types i.e. ``complex32, complex64, complex128``.


Args:
    input: input tensor of shape :math:`(\text{minibatch} , \text{in\_channels} , iH , iW)`
    weight: filters of shape :math:`(\text{out\_channels} , \frac{\text{in\_channels}}{\text{groups}} , kH , kW)`
    bias: optional bias tensor of shape :math:`(\text{out\_channels})`. Default: ``None``
    stride: the stride of the convolving kernel. Can be a single number or a
      tuple `(sH, sW)`. Default: 1
    padding: implicit paddings on both sides of the input. Can be a string {'valid', 'same'},
      single number or a tuple `(padH, padW)`. Default: 0
      ``padding='valid'`` is the same as no padding. ``padding='same'`` pads
      the input so the output has the same shape as the input. However, this mode
      doesn't support any stride values other than 1.

      .. warning::
          For ``padding='same'``, if the ``weight`` is even-length and
          ``dilation`` is odd in any dimension, a full :func:`pad` operation
          may be needed internally. Lowering performance.

    dilation: the spacing between kernel elements. Can be a single number or
      a tuple `(dH, dW)`. Default: 1
    groups: split input into groups, both :math:`\text{in\_channels}` and :math:`\text{out\_channels}`
      should be divisible by the number of groups. Default: 1

Examples::

```python
    >>> # With square kernels and equal stride
    >>> filters = torch.randn(8, 4, 3, 3)
    >>> inputs = torch.randn(1, 4, 5, 5)
    >>> F.conv2d(inputs, filters, padding=1)
```

## Implementation

Place your generated kernel implementation in this directory as:
- `convolution_implementation_v1.py`
- `convolution_implementation_v2.py`
- etc.

Each implementation file should contain a function named:
```python
def convolution_kernel_impl(*args, **kwargs):
    # Your implementation here
    # Should match the behavior documented above
    pass
```

## Testing

The DirectoryBackend will automatically load the first implementation file found in this directory.
