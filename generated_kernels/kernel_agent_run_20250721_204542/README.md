# Generated Kernels - KernelAgent - 20250721_204542

This directory contains PyTorch/Triton kernels generated by the KernelAgent Backend.

## Run Info
- Timestamp: 20250721_204542
- Backend: KernelAgent
- Features: Parallel workers, iterative refinement, conversation history

## Files
Each `<op_name>_kernel.py` file contains the complete generated kernel code for that operation.
KernelAgent session directories contain detailed logs, worker outputs, and generation artifacts.

## KernelAgent Features Used
- Parallel workers for increased success rate
- Iterative refinement with multi-turn dialogue
- Comprehensive Triton programming guidelines
- Automatic test generation and validation
- Session logging and artifact preservation

## Usage
You can inspect these files to debug kernel generation, analyze the parallel worker outputs,
or understand the sophisticated generation process used by KernelAgent.
