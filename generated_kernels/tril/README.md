## PyTorch Documentation

tril(input, diagonal=0, *, out=None) -> Tensor

Returns the lower triangular part of the matrix (2-D tensor) or batch of matrices
:attr:`input`, the other elements of the result tensor :attr:`out` are set to 0.

The lower triangular part of the matrix is defined as the elements on and
below the diagonal.

The argument :attr:`diagonal` controls which diagonal to consider. If
:attr:`diagonal` = 0, all elements on and below the main diagonal are
retained. A positive value includes just as many diagonals above the main
diagonal, and similarly a negative value excludes just as many diagonals below
the main diagonal. The main diagonal are the set of indices
:math:`\lbrace (i, i) \rbrace` for :math:`i \in [0, \min\{d_{1}, d_{2}\} - 1]` where
:math:`d_{1}, d_{2}` are the dimensions of the matrix.

Args:
    input (Tensor): the input tensor.
    diagonal (int, optional): the diagonal to consider

Keyword args:
    out (Tensor, optional): the output tensor.

Example::

```python
    >>> a = torch.randn(3, 3)
    >>> a
```
    tensor([[-1.0813, -0.8619,  0.7105],
            [ 0.0935,  0.1380,  2.2112],
            [-0.3409, -0.9828,  0.0289]])
```python
    >>> torch.tril(a)
```
    tensor([[-1.0813,  0.0000,  0.0000],
            [ 0.0935,  0.1380,  0.0000],
            [-0.3409, -0.9828,  0.0289]])

```python
    >>> b = torch.randn(4, 6)
    >>> b
```

## Implementation

Place your generated kernel implementation in this directory as:
- `tril_implementation_v1.py`
- `tril_implementation_v2.py`
- etc.

Each implementation file should contain a function named:
```python
def tril_kernel_impl(*args, **kwargs):
    # Your implementation here
    # Should match the behavior documented above
    pass
```

## Testing

The DirectoryBackend will automatically load the first implementation file found in this directory.
